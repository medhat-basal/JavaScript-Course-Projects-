Projects for Scrimba JavaScript Course
As part of the Code2Career training application, I completed three projects from the "Learn JavaScript for Free" course by Scrimba. These projects demonstrate my ability to learn independently and solve coding challenges.
Projects included:

Subway Passenger Counter

Blackjack Casino Game

Chrome Extension
Each project was developed following course instructions and uploaded here for review.
